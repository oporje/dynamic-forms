### development notes

Used react hooks to write the code.

Built a dynamic signup form, with 4 primitive input types: 
1) text 
2) email 
3) checkbox 
4) password.

## components

Used unique components as per the given input.

1) TextTnput: Component for input type: text, email.
2) PasswordInput: Component for password.
3) CheckboxBase: component for input type: checkbox.
4) ErrorMessage: component that displayes error message for all the input types.
5) SignupForm: Component is a form container, which takes care of controlled form and handles validation and onSubmit funtionalities.

## Enhancements

This can be enhanced to build any kind of forms by adding components for all the primitive input types and respective validations.
Css can be improved definitely

I have written 5 test cases mainly to showcase error scenario and how to write, simulate , find using Enzyme.
More test coverage can be done. I had some constraints, purpose was to showcase that awareness/knowledge of how to write Unit test cases.

## Steps to build on your local

1. Download / clone the code
2. run `npm i` command to install all the packages
3. run `npm start` command to start the application

## Thank you :) Enjoyed it !
